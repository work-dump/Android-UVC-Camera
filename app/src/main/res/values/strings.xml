Camera stream over Usb.\n
OTG cabel or OTG Hub needed\n
It works with Micro Usb and Usb Type C devices\n
(Some OTG cabels doesn\'t work --> I\'ll found one which is an extern powered more Port USB-C OTG cable and doesn\'t work ...)\n
All phones, tablets with all chipsets are supported\n
Explaination:\n
First you have to set up your Camera with the values for the isochronous data transfer.\n
Use the "Set up the camera device" button --> Search for a camera.\n
Next you can list the interfaces and endpoints of the camera. (List the camera button)\n
To automatic find the camera values click on: "Set up with uvc values" button. (you need a UVC compliance camera)\n
You can save your settings and restore them later, for faster setup.\n\n
Next important part is the Testrun for your camera.\n
Thirst you have to perform a controlltransfer.
Click "Testrun" --> "Controltransfer" --> "and perform the first Controltransfer.\n
If the controlltransfer was sucessful, you can read out one frame. The frame will be displayed below.\n
Next you can Read out all the frames for 5 secounds.\n
Have a look at your frames: If they are all identically and big enougth, than you can proceed to start the camera stream with the "Start the camera stream" button from the main screen.\n\n
Otherwise you have to edit some values for your camera: Perhaps -PacketsPerRequest- or -ActiveUrbs-, or something else.\n\n
Click the "Transmission Start" --> "Start the Camera" Button to start the transmission.\n
If everything works, you can watch the video of your camera.\n\n
